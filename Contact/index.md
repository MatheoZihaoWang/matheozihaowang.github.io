I very much look forward to meeting you!

[//]: # (We are recruiting motivated and hard-working people interested in Bayesian methods and computation, graphical models, sequential decision making, reinforcement learning and large-scale health data analytics. )

[//]: # (I am extremely fortunate to have worked with many excellent graduate students at UM. Under an apprenticeship model, I have been working closely with my students to gain practical research experience, which when combined with individual studentsâ€™ particular strengths led to mutually rewarding collaborations and research results. My goal in mentoring is to train students who will be highly sought-after in areas of their interests upon graduation.)
