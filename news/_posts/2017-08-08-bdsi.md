For six weeks, 44 undergraduate students from across the country met at Ann Arbor to wrestle with big data. The hands-on projects, in addition to lectures about statistics, informatics and professional development, are part of their training at [2017 Big Data Summer Institute](https://sph.umich.edu/bdsi/) hosted by our department. Among them, eleven students learned and applied methods to analyzing the Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. In four groups, they created their own data sets from [Michigan Genomics Initiative](https://www.michigangenomics.org/) that contains genomic information, longitudinal diagnoses, procedures and lab measurements and more to investigate [heart failure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ht_TCS6xC-Zm5RWHByeWdUd2M/view), [phenomewide association for lab values](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ht_TCS6xC-VjRsZkJfalVNbVk/view), Type 2 Diabetes and [infectious diseases](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ht_TCS6xC-bzRTUTlQek9JRGM/view). It was great pleasure working with you!
