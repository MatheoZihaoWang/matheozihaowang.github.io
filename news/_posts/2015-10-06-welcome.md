Theory and experiment, the pillars of 19-20th century science, have been joined
by computation and big data in the 21st.

I am always looking for people who take a quantitative approach to studying public health, biology and biomedicine. Particular emphasis is placed on scalable Bayesian (graphical) modeling, latent variables, causal inference and especially their intersection. If you think you may be interested, please [get in touch](/team/zihao-wang).

I'd be happy to answer questions on research and software!
