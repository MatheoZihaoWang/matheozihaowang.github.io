I am now teaching a PhD-level special topics course: BIOSTAT830 *Statistical and Computational Methods for Learning Through Graphical Models*, which will cover representation, inference, learning and causality demonstrated by case studies on real problems. Feel free to get what you need or comment on the course [webpage](/teaching/graphical_model).
