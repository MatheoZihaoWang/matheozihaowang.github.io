I gave a talk for 'DALI: The MICCAI Workshop on Data Augmentation, Labeling, and Imperfections', 1 October 2021, Online. 
The presentations will introduce our recent work of using one-shot learning for cochlea landmarks. In this talk, he will show how to use only one annotated cochlea CT volume for detecting hundreds of cochlea volumes landmarks. This research is a part of CIMPLE research project.
