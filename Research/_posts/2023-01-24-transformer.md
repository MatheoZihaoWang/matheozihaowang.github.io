# Abstract

We propose three novel patch-based registration architectures using only MLPs and Transformers. The authors demonstrate that their single and multi-scale models perform similarly and even better to CNN-based registration frameworks on a large echocardiography dataset. The three proposed models demonstrate similar performance among themselves. The experiments show that patch-based models using MLP/Transformer can perform 2D medical image registration. The authors conclude that the success of Transformer in vision tasks cannot be simply attributed to the attention mechanism, at least in image registration tasks. Future works will concentrate on the application of MLP/Transformer in time-series motion tracking.
