# Research Interest

*"Methods for Summarizing and Imputing High-Frequency Digital Biomarkers in the Context of Longitudinal Data Analysis"*

Nicole focuses on high-frequency digital biomarker data in Alzheimer’s and dementia research. Her research position at the Michigan Alzheimer’s Data Center has led to her interest in functional data analysis as a method to investigate trajectories of digital biomarkers as predictors of cognitive decline.
