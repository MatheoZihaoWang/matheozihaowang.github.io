# Notes

* After cloning the repo to your local folder, you'll need to install jekyll to build and test your modified site. 

* fonts
	- Use [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) to publish fonts you like; register an Adobe account;
	- Modify `$font-stack` in `/assets/themes/lab/css/style.scss` to include your fonts. Extra font names are used as fallbacks.
* posts
    - To add a post, e.g., a new paper, follow the format of the existing `.md` files
    - Comment out `</div>` if there are a multiple of three papers in each subsection; otherwise, there will be errors of indentation. 
* tracking
	- To link your site to Google analytic services, modify the `tracking_id` in `_config.yml` file in the root directory so that it points to your website. 
	- Replace the `tracking_id` with your own id in the following block of codes in `_config.yml`
    
    ```
    analytics :
        provider : google
   		google : 
      	  tracking_id : 'UA-57530925-1'
    ```
* twitter feed:
    - Follow the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/abhisheknaik96/26ce79ac7a307eb836dcf02a52f87cf2) and [here](https://keitaito.com/blog/2017/01/20/embedding-tweets-in-github-pages.html). The basic idea is to **locally** use the following
    to embed a tweet.
    
    ```
    <div class='jekyll-twitter-plugin' align="center">
    {% twitter https://twitter.com/anaik96 maxwidth=500 limit=5 %}
    </div>
    ```

     Run `bundle exec jekyll server` to generate a subfolder `_site/` and then find the generated `.html` file that contains the code block for embedding your tweet. Copy the code block such as
    
    ```html
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For our first ever <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StudentSpotlight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StudentSpotlight</a>, we&#39;re excited to feature Tim NeCamp who graduated in May and is an official <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/alum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#alum</a>! Timâ€™s interests lie in the areas of experimental design, causal inference, intensive longitudinal data, and....<br>Read More: <a href="https://t.co/NYfWov7wDk">https://t.co/NYfWov7wDk</a> <a href="https://t.co/S6D3sM2vo7">pic.twitter.com/S6D3sM2vo7</a></p>&mdash; Statistics (@UMichStatistics) <a href="https://twitter.com/UMichStatistics/status/1144334755506401283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2019</a></blockquote>
    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    ```

    and replace the above `div` block.

* MathJax (also see [here](http://www.idryman.org/blog/2012/03/10/writing-math-equations-on-octopress/) )
	- To properly display the math expressions rendered by MathJax, 
		+ Add `kramdown` after on the line of `markdown: ` in `_config.yml`; this prevents markdown language to intervene with LaTex commands; Also put `gem 'kramdown'` in `Gemfile`;
	- Add the following code block to /_includes/themes/lab/default.html, before `</head>`
	
>
    <!-- Math via MathJax -->
    <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
        MathJax.Hub.Config({
            extensions: ["tex2jax.js"],
            jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],
            tex2jax: {
                inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],
                displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],
                processEscapes: true
            },
        "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] }
        });
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>


* projects
    - For each repo (in the folder `/_data`), the `url` should not end with `/`. For example, use `url: /projects/baker`, instead of `url: /projects/baker/`
* navigation:
    - For example, the "papers" tab is specified in the folder "papers/". At the top, `title` is for tab name; `group` can be either `navigation` or `subnavigation` depending on whether you want to show this tab or collapse into the "More" tab; `navorder` specifies the order appearing in the navigation bar (1 for the first tab).
* team
    - for photos, set roughly 200px wide and 300px height, with resolution 144. The width requirement is to help display the photo properly on an individual's page.

 ## Other Technicalities
 * `categories`
    - refers to the subfolders in the main directory without an underscore `_`;
    - is used to refer to specific locations in the website (my current guess is that the definition of `categories` ships with the engine of jekyll, so no need to user-define categories)
* style sheets
    - There are two that matter: `/assets/themes/lab/css/style.scss` and `/assets/themes/css/style.scss`; The former works for posts, the latter for pages PRIOR to entering posts. 
    - This might best be fixed, but I don't have time now to check how they are currently used in different pages.
* team page
    - Currently the [landing page of the Team](https://github.com/zhenkewu/zhenkewu.github.io/blob/master/team/index.md) is four-column circular headshots (without stacking if the screen is wider than 576px). The circular image is achieved via `border-radius: 50%` - one may remove this to return to rectangular.
    - Please check [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_examples.asp) for making changes regarding the landing page of Team based on the Bootstrap grid system.# matheozihaowang.github.io
